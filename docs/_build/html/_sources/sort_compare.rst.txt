sort_compare
------------

A data minipulation file which times each sorting algorithm on ten sorts of randomly generated data and
 graphs the resulting times for ease of comparison. Note that radix sort is kept from the graphs as the time disparity 
 caused the other bars to be invisibly small. The full raw data is shown in stats/sorting_results.txt. Graphs are stored in stats/plots
